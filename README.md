## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project was fantastic for sharpening my media query skills. I had become too reliant on Bootstrap when it came to mobile-responsiveness and general flexbox knowledge. Initially, I did use Bootstrap, and it was a struggle. I could not get my divs to look right at the specified resolutions. When I submitted my solution to this challenge, I was helped by another user who suggested I remove Bootstrap entirely and try without it. Through some studying and a lot of trial and error, I was able to figure the media queries out and produce the proper results.

### Continued development

I may tweak the margins and padding here and there in the future, just to try to get it as close to perfect as possible.

### Useful resources

- [A Guide To Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This is a wonderful cheat-sheet that I used for understanding flexbox.
- [Media Queries For Standard Devices](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/media-queries-for-standard-devices/) - I also got a lot out of this article, which gives great examples of your typical media queries.
